# Welcome! üëã

You are going to stretch your Javascript knowledge and make you more confident with one of the most popular programming languages in the world üåè!

Many of the concepts you will cover you may be familiar with but familiarity !== understanding.

That leads us to our philosophy on learning:

### You Learn Best By Doing!

We have laid out the most common concepts that confuse JS developers. Here's how we suggest you tackle this material.

1. Watch the videos under each sections `README.md`
2. Read any related articles that are linked
3. <strong>Everyone learns differently</strong> - feel free to look up these concepts using the medium you prefer to round out your knowledge
4. Each module has broken unit tests... you need to fix them with the correct code
5. Often times, the solution will be in the video in the `README.md` - DO NOT simply copy the answer from there! You will learn nothing
6. For the love of Bob, please do the `Your Turn` sections in each `README.md` - these will help you really retain the information!

We know that getting your dream job as a software engineer or excelling in your current role requires a strong technical foundation but that's not all!

Your LinkedIn, resume and general job strategy must be aligned with your goals and your mindset must be in the correct state to perform to the best of your ability.

Use the material in the rest of this course to fix those aspects and don't hesitate to reach out for help via email or to set up a short 1 to 1.

### Setup

---

1. Fork this repo OR open in Code Spaces with Git Pod
2. In your terminal run `npm install`
3. To run tests - first unskip the tests in the file you are working on by removing all `skip`s. Then run `npm test`. To test a specific file: `npm test path/to/file.test.js`
4. Once you complete a module, send a quick video walking through your work and a screenshot of the passing tests (or include it in the video) via Slack or email at brianjenney@jswizards.io
